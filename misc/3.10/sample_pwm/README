Ingenic PWM channel configuration:

You may modify the Makefile to open PWM0 by default. If you want to open multiple channels, just open the corresponding macro;

1. Note: T10 T20 only has channels 0~3; T30 has channels 0~7.
DEFS += -DCONFIG_PWM0
DEFS += -DCONFIG_PWM1
DEFS += -DCONFIG_PWM2
DEFS += -DCONFIG_PWM3
#DEFS += -DCONFIG_PWM4
#DEFS += -DCONFIG_PWM5
#DEFS += -DCONFIG_PWM6
#DEFS += -DCONFIG_PWM7

2. KO loading
The order of loading the modules is important; load sample_pwm_core.ko first, followed by sample_pwm_hal.ko to ensure proper
operation.

3. Notes:
T30 uses PC group GPIO by default. If you use the PB group GPIO, you need to make the following modifications manually.
Kernel file arch/mips/xburst/soc-t21/common/platform.c jzpwm_pdata PC17, PC18 changed to PB17, PB18
